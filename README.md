This game was created as an AP Computer Science A end-of-year project. Special thanks to Ms. Paymer for her teaching and guidance, and thanks to Morgan Langstaff for her friendship and support in the face of countless ArrayOutOfBounds exceptions.

Aces Down is a solitaire game where the goal is to discard all the cards except the four ace cards. The game starts with four piles of one card each. There are three actions available to the player:
- Discard. A card can be discarded only if there is a card of the same suit and lower rank sitting at the top of any pile.
- Move. If there is an empty pile, the top card of any pile can be moved to the empty spot.
- Deal. Deal four cards from the deck. One new card is placed on top of each pile.
The score is the number of cards that have been discarded. The maximum (winning) score is 48.
